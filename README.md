# applepickergamedemo
It's just an "ApplePicker" game from one popular book now. But I`ll come back sometime to see what my start looked like.

A simple game from "Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development" by Jeremy Gibson Bond.

- A moving object that changes direction randomly.
- Object spawner.
- Objects` contact recognition and reaction to them (delete one catcher or get 100 points).
- High score calculating system.
- Scene restart.

Not sure that someone needs it but thank you for your time and good luck. :)
